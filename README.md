<h3>A Matrix Calculator</h3>

Given a matrix, this calculator can invert and scalonate it. To build the project, i used Object-Orientation, Test-Driven-Development and Gaussian Elimintation algorithm for solving systems of linear equations.
This project was made for Linear Algebra course at Federal University of Para√≠ba.
